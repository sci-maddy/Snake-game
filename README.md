# Snake

Clone of famous snake game. Programmed as a project for NPRG030 Programming 1 at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University. 

To play the game, you need to have installed Pygame module. 
You can install it following this tutorial http://kidscancode.org/blog/2015/09/pygame_install/

After running the program, a new window appears on your screen. The blue square is the head of your snake, now its only one block long. 
To start the game, press any of the arrow keys. Your snake will start to move in the desired direction. To change his direction, just
press some another arrow key. 

The aim is to collect the yellow squares with your snake, which symbolises food. After eating food, your score will rise and your snake
will elongate. To make things more complicated, you cannot run into the wall with the snake or run into the snake itself with it's head. 
If this happens, the game is over, so the Game Over screen appears together with your score in this game and with the highest score 
from all of the previous games you've played. 

If you want to play another game, just press Spacebar. If you want to end the game, press Esc key or click the cross in the right up corner
of the window. 

There's a slight difference from the traditional snake, and that is that there are two pieces of food instead of one. I think it's more fun
like this and the progress in the game is quicker.
